Sorting Algorithm Project

This project is an SFML App made in c++ to visualize sorting algorithms. It contains selection, bubble, insertion, and merge sort on a randomly generated list.
This app is very user-friendly and interactive. Just choose your array size and choose the sorting algorithm you want to visualize.
